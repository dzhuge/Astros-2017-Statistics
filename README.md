 In 2017 (Possibly 2018 & 2019), the Houston Astros used a setup with a monitor (and laptop?) in the dugout and a trashcan. The monitor was used to steal signs made by the opposing team's catcher.

After the sign was made, a trash can was hit to signal to the batter what pitch was incoming. No bangs meant a fastball was coming, a bang meant an off-speed pitch (slider, curve ball, etc.)

While the Astros have a very talented team, their cheating set-up was a factor in their World Series winning season.

I use Tableau to compare statistics across the league.
